# Self.Env - A Decentralized Self-hosted Secret Management Service

Self.Env is a decentralized self-hosted secret management service that allows you to store and manage your secrets in a secure and private way. Every secret is encrypted and stored on your on-chain. Users in the Web2 and Web3 world can manage their secrets in a decentralized way. Using ACls and permissions, users can share their secrets with other users or applications.

## Goals

- **Private**: Self.Env allows users to self-host their canisters.
- **Decentralized**: Self.Env is a decentralized service that allows users to store and manage their secrets in a decentralized way.
- **Secure**: Every secret is encrypted before reaching the service using Vet-keys.
- **Open-source**: It's an open-source project that allows users to contribute to the project.
- **Interoperable**: It's an interoperable service that allows users to manage their secrets in the Web2 and Web3 world.
- **Multi-environment**: It's a multi-environment service that allows users to manage their secrets in different environments.

Self.env CLI is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the Self.Env service. Users can manage their secrets, create and manage their canisters, and share their secrets with other users or applications. This will have an interface that allows building SDKs for different languages.
